`lld` is now provided in a separate formula:

To use the bundled libunwind please use the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/unwind -lunwind"

To use the bundled libc++ please use the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/c++ -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/unwind -lunwind"

NOTE: You probably want to use the libunwind and libc++ provided by macOS unless you know what you're doing.

llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"
